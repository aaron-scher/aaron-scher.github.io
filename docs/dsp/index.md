# DSP Teaching Materials

Lab materials for a Digital Signal Processing (DSP) course. These labs were developed at Oregon Institute of Technology for EE 430.

## Labs

1. **[Working with Signals in MATLAB](dsp-lab1-signals.md)** — Creating, visualizing, and analyzing signals; sinusoids, Fourier series, and spectral analysis with the FFT.

2. **[Sampling and Aliasing](dsp-lab2-sampling.md)** — Sampling theory, the Nyquist criterion, aliasing, and reconstruction of signals.

3. **[Discrete Time Systems and Convolution](dsp-lab3-convolution.md)** — LTI systems, impulse response, convolution, and digital filtering (moving-average and FIR filters).

4. **[DTMF Tone and Song Generator](dsp-lab4-dtmf-generator.md)** — Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency signaling, tone generation, audio synthesis, and spectrogram analysis.

5. **[DTMF Tone Sequence Detector](dsp-lab5-dtmf-detector.md)** — Designing a DTMF decoder using filter banks, signal detection, and frequency analysis.
